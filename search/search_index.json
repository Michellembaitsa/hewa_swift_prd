Summary: An air purifying system that cleans the air inside the vehicles and reduces the chances of respiratory disease infection cases in Kenyan Public Service Vehicles. Problem: The product solves a problem faced by many commuters in the PSVs of the air being stuffy and not clean for humans and the increased rate of respiratory disease infections as well. Solution: An IoT air purifying device that brings in clean air and releases dirty air outside the vehicle leaving the vehicle with clean air for human intake. Getting Started: The user only needs to install the system into the vehicle and it is automatically turned on when the air levels are polluted. Background. Currently, research on air quality in Kenya is being done by foreign organizations such as the US IQ air monitoring index. There is no official local air quality monitoring data system. In as much as, there have been 33 air pollution studies in Kenya since the 80\u2019s that report concentrations of widespread pollution in Kenya, there is still no evidence to show a direct relationship between air pollution and respiratory-related diseases. Furthermore, the most recent data we obtained from our Desk Research was from 2019. This might not be the true reflection of the current air quality situation in Kenya as the number might have gone up or reduced significantly. The team, therefore, decided to conduct primary research to better understand the current air quality situation in Kenya, especially in PSVs to help them make better-informed decisions. Goals Our goal as Hewa Swift is to develop a sustainable air quality monitoring system to be used in Kenyan Public Service Vehicles. This is particularly important to us, as we understand the need of such a system in PSV\u2019S. 40.6% of Kenyans use PSV\u2019s as their main means of transport.This illustrates that a great percentage of Kenyans are indeed much more susceptible to respiratory disease infections directly caused by PSV emissions. The starting point of this air quality monitoring project is to first study if an area has an air pollution problem. Monitoring helps in assessing the level of pollution in relation to the ambient air quality standards. Standards are a regulatory measure to set the target for pollution reduction and achieve clean air. We are looking to compare air quality conditions at different locations/cities which will be a key factor in decision making. Why build it? From the research we carried out, we noticed that the rate of respiratory diseases here in Kenya were mainly caused by emissions from the vehicles, and because of this, we thought of coming up with an IoT device that will help in cleaning the air inside the car to help reduce the rate of respiratory diseases here in Kenya.
